    * Step 2.3. Read activity labels
    * Step 2.4. Read the test data with variables defined in step 2.1 and 2.2 as col.names
    * Step 2.5. Read the training data with variables defined in step 2.1 and 2.2 as col.names
           
* Step 3. Merge test and train data and create the OneDataSet
        
    * Step 3.1. Column bind test data
    * Step 3.2. Column bind train data
    * Step 3.3. Row bind test and train data
     
* Step 4. Limit to only the required columns.
      
    * Step 4.1. Find only the mean (or) std (or) Activity (or) Subject columns
    * Step 4.2 Update OneDataSet to contain only the required columns.
  
* Step 5. Merge Activity name to OneDataDet and return the Tidy Data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
    
* Step 6. Write the Tidy Data to a text file.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating 
the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained 
by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

**For each record it is provided:**
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


**Feature Selection in input data set:**

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a 
constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

max(): Largest value in array  <br/>
min(): Smallest value in array  <br/>
sma(): Signal magnitude area  <br/>

iqr(): Interquartile range <br/>
entropy(): Signal entropy  <br/>
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4  <br/>
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals  <br/>
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude  <br/>
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency  <br/>
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal   <br/>
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal   <br/>
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.  <br/>
angle(): Angle between to vectors.  <br/>


Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
